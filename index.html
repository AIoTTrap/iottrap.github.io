  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  PestDetective is an AI-powered tool designed for pest control and management. 
  This project aims to create a comprehensive platform that utilizes computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify
  pests and monitor their movements. The platform includes two key features - Pest Detection, and Teachable Machine - that work
  together to provide a complete pest control solution.
  

  <h1>Backround</h1>
  Pest infestations are a major problem in agriculture and can cause significant damage to crops,
  resulting in reduced yields and increased costs for farmers. Traditional pest control methods are often
  inefficient and can be harmful to the environment. The use of AI-powered tools such as PestDetective can provide a more
  effective and sustainable solution for pest control and management.

  <h1>Applications</h1>
  PestDetective has a wide range of applications across various industries, including agriculture, pest control,
  and research. Farmers can use PestDetective to identify pests in their crops and fields and implement targeted
  control measures. Pest control professionals can use PestDetective to monitor pest movement in real-time and
  provide more effective pest control services. Researchers can use PestDetective to collect data on pest populations
  and movements for analysis and modeling purposes.

  <h1>Features</h1>
  <li> Pest photo detection: Users can upload a pest photo, and the YOLOv3 model will detect the type of pest and display
  bounding boxes around it. </li>
  <li> ESP32 pest detection: Users can use an ESP32 board with a PIR sensor to detect pest movement, and the YOLOv3 model will
  detect the type of pest and display bounding boxes around it. </li>
  <li> Teachable Machine: Users can upload a zip folder of images and train a custom TensorFlow/Keras model to classify pests. 
  The trained model can then be used to classify new images. </li>

  <h2>Pest Photo Upload: </h2>
    The Pest Photo Upload feature allows users to upload a photo of a pest and receive instant identification of the type 
    of pest with bounding boxes displayed around it. This feature is useful for identifying pests in crops and fields 
    for proper control measures. This feature currently detects 5 classes:
    Beetles <br>
    Caterpillars <br>
    Snails <br>
    Ants <br>
    Insects <br>
    
    <h2>ESP32 Detection:</h2>
    The ESP32 Detection feature allows users to receive notifications of pest movement detected by an ESP32 device. 
    This feature is particularly useful for monitoring pests in real-time and preventing infestati</p>

    <h3>Teachable Machine</h3>
    The Teachable Machine feature allows users to train their own image classification model and customize their
    pest detection system to their specific needs. This feature is particularly useful for farmers and agriculture
    researchers who need to identify unique pests or specific stages of pest development. It may also be used for
    any other classes apart from 'Pests'.

    The user has to prepare a set of photos in a zip folder. The directory should look like this: <br>
    folder_name/      <br>
    |&emsp;  |— class_1_name/   <br>
    |&emsp;  |&emsp;&emsp;   |— image1.jpg     <br>
    |&emsp;  |&emsp;&emsp;   |— image2.jpg     <br>
    |&emsp;  |&emsp;&emsp;   |— image3.jpg     <br>
    |&emsp;  |&emsp;&emsp;   |_ ...            <br>
    |&emsp;  |     <br>
    |&emsp;  |— class_2_name/   <br>
    |&emsp;  |&emsp;&emsp;   |— image1.jpg     <br>
    |&emsp;  |&emsp;&emsp;   |— image2.jpg     <br>
    |&emsp;  |&emsp;&emsp;   |— image3.jpg     <br>
    |&emsp;  |&emsp;&emsp;   |_ ...  <br><br>

    This feature currently trains images for 10 epochs. 
    Once the zip file is submitted, the training will begin. This might take a while.
    Training will be completed once the user receives the model file in their downloads.


    Model Testing:
    The user simply uploads the TensorFlow model file and the test image.

    <h3>Training for object detection</h3>
    This feature also allows the user to train a custom model for object detection with bounding boxes.
    The user should have the following image directory ready: <br>
    <p style="font-size: small;">
      <br> |-folder_name
      <br> | &emsp; |
      <br> | &emsp; |- train
      <br> | &emsp; | &emsp;   |
      <br> | &emsp; | &emsp;   |- image_name1.jpg
      <br> | &emsp; | &emsp;   |- image_name1.xml
      <br> | &emsp; | &emsp;   |- image_name2.jpg
      <br> | &emsp; | &emsp;   |- image_name2.xml
      <br> | &emsp; | &emsp;   |_ ...
      <br> | &emsp; |      
      <br> | &emsp; |- valid
      <br> | &emsp; | &emsp;   |
      <br> | &emsp; | &emsp;   |- image_name1.jpg
      <br> | &emsp; | &emsp;   |- image_name1.xml
      <br> | &emsp; | &emsp;   |- image_name2.jpg
      <br> | &emsp; | &emsp;   |- image_name2.xml
      <br> | &emsp; | &emsp;   |_ ...
       </p>
       <br>
  
      The Annotations must be in Pascal VOC XML format. The user may use Roboflow to convert any annotation type.
      Create a .txt file that contains the names of all the classes you want to detect, with each class name on a separate line.
