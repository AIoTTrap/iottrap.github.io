  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  PestDetective is an AI-powered tool designed for pest control and management. 
  This project aims to create a comprehensive platform that utilizes computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify
  pests and monitor their movements. The platform includes two key features - Pest Detection, and Teachable Machine - that work
  together to provide a complete pest control solution.
  

  <h1>Backround</h1>
  Pest infestations are a major problem in agriculture and can cause significant damage to crops,
  resulting in reduced yields and increased costs for farmers. Traditional pest control methods are often
  inefficient and can be harmful to the environment. The use of AI-powered tools such as PestDetective can provide a more
  effective and sustainable solution for pest control and management.

  <h1>Applications</h1>
  PestDetective has a wide range of applications across various industries, including agriculture, pest control,
  and research. Farmers can use PestDetective to identify pests in their crops and fields and implement targeted
  control measures. Pest control professionals can use PestDetective to monitor pest movement in real-time and
  provide more effective pest control services. Researchers can use PestDetective to collect data on pest populations
  and movements for analysis and modeling purposes.

  <h1>Features</h1>
  <li> Pest photo detection: Users can upload a pest photo, and the YOLOv3 model will detect the type of pest and display
  bounding boxes around it. </li>
  <li> ESP32 pest detection: Users can use an ESP32 board with a PIR sensor to detect pest movement, and the YOLOv3 model will
  detect the type of pest and display bounding boxes around it. </li>
  <li> Teachable Machine: Users can upload a zip folder of images and train a custom TensorFlow/Keras model to classify pests. 
  The trained model can then be used to classify new images. </li>

  <p>Pest Photo Upload:
    The Pest Photo Upload feature allows users to upload a photo of a pest and receive instant identification of the type 
    of pest with bounding boxes displayed around it. This feature is useful for identifying pests in crops and fields 
    for proper control measures. This feature currently detects 5 classes:
    Beetles
    Caterpillars
    Snails
    Ants
    Insects
    
    ESP32 Detection:
    The ESP32 Detection feature allows users to receive notifications of pest movement detected by an ESP32 device. 
    This feature is particularly useful for monitoring pests in real-time and preventing infestati</p>
