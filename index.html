  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  PestDetective is an AI-powered tool designed for pest control and management. 
  This project aims to create a comprehensive platform that utilizes computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify
  pests and monitor their movements. The platform includes two key features - Pest Detection, and Teachable Machine - that work
  together to provide a complete pest control solution.
  

  <h1>Backround</h1>
  Effective pest control is vital for agricultural industries, as pests can cause significant damage to crops, resulting
  in economic losses and reduced food production. Traditional pest control methods often face challenges such as labor-intensive
  processes, delays in pest identification, and limited monitoring capabilities. These shortcomings necessitate the development
  of an advanced solution that harnesses the power of AI, computer vision, and machine learning algorithms to overcome these
  challenges and revolutionize agricultural pest control.

  <h1>Key Features</h1>
  <h2>1. Pest Detection</h2>
  The Pest Detection feature lies at the core of PestDetective, utilizing advanced computer vision algorithms to analyze 
  images or video footage and accurately identify pests. Through extensive training on annotated datasets, deep learning 
  models within the platform can recognize a wide range of pests with high accuracy. Real-time monitoring capabilities and 
  an alert system can notify farmers of pest presence, allowing for immediate action to mitigate potential crop damage.

    <h3>Pest Photo Upload: </h3>
    The Pest Photo Upload feature allows users to upload a photo of a pest and receive instant identification of the type 
    of pest with bounding boxes displayed around it. This feature is useful for identifying pests in crops and fields 
    for proper control measures. This feature currently detects 5 classes: <br>
    <blockquote>
    Beetles <br>
    Caterpillars <br>
    Snails <br>
    Ants <br>
    Insects <br>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>ESP32 Detection:</h3>
    The ESP32 Detection feature allows users to receive notifications of pest movement detected by an ESP32 device. 
    This feature is particularly useful for monitoring pests in real-time and preventing infestations.</p> <br>

    </div>

  <h2>2. Teachable Machine</h2>
  The Teachable Machine feature empowers farmers to actively participate in training the AI model to identify specific pests
  relevant to their agricultural settings. Farmers can upload their own images of pests, enabling the system to learn and 
  adapt to new pest species. The user-friendly interface facilitates the training process, allowing farmers to customize the
  platform according to their specific needs and optimize pest control strategies accordingly.
  
  <em>  Note: This system may also be used for
  any other classes apart from 'Pests'. </em>


  <h1>Implementation and Technical Details</h1>
  PestDetective utilizes a combination of technologies to deliver its pest control capabilities. 
  The platform integrates computer vision libraries, including OpenCV, and powerful deep learning frameworks such as 
  TensorFlow. This integration enables the platform to efficiently process visual data and extract meaningful 
  information for pest identification. <br>
  <br>
  The data preprocessing stage is a crucial step in preparing the large datasets of pest images for training. 
  It involves cleaning the data and annotating it with relevant labels to facilitate supervised learning. By accurately 
  labeling the images with corresponding pest species, the platform can learn from these annotated datasets during the 
  training phase. 

  <h3>Training for image classification</h3>

    The user must prepare set of photos in a zip folder. The directory should look like this: <br>
    folder_name/      <br>
    |&emsp;  |— class_1_name/   <br>
    |&emsp;  |&emsp;&emsp;   |— image1.jpg     <br>
    |&emsp;  |&emsp;&emsp;   |— image2.jpg     <br>
    |&emsp;  |&emsp;&emsp;   |— image3.jpg     <br>
    |&emsp;  |&emsp;&emsp;   |_ ...            <br>
    |&emsp;  |     <br>
    |&emsp;  |— class_2_name/   <br>
    |&emsp;  |&emsp;&emsp;   |— image1.jpg     <br>
    |&emsp;  |&emsp;&emsp;   |— image2.jpg     <br>
    |&emsp;  |&emsp;&emsp;   |— image3.jpg     <br>
    |&emsp;  |&emsp;&emsp;   |_ ...  <br><br>

    This feature currently trains images for 10 epochs.  <br>
    Once the zip file is submitted, the training will begin. This might take a while. <br>
    Training will be completed once the user receives the model file in their downloads. <br><br>


    <em> Note: To test the model, the user simply uploads the recieved TensorFlow model file and the test image. </em> <br>

    Visualising training process for ~3000 custom train dataset and ~700 validation dataset (5 classes): <br>

    </div>


    <h3>Training for object detection</h3>
    This feature also allows the user to train a custom model for object detection with bounding boxes.
    The user should have the following image directory ready: <br>
    <p style="font-size: small;">
      <br> |-folder_name
      <br> | &emsp; |
      <br> | &emsp; |- train
      <br> | &emsp; | &emsp;   |
      <br> | &emsp; | &emsp;   |- image_name1.jpg
      <br> | &emsp; | &emsp;   |- image_name1.xml
      <br> | &emsp; | &emsp;   |- image_name2.jpg
      <br> | &emsp; | &emsp;   |- image_name2.xml
      <br> | &emsp; | &emsp;   |_ ...
      <br> | &emsp; |      
      <br> | &emsp; |- valid
      <br> | &emsp; | &emsp;   |
      <br> | &emsp; | &emsp;   |- image_name1.jpg
      <br> | &emsp; | &emsp;   |- image_name1.xml
      <br> | &emsp; | &emsp;   |- image_name2.jpg
      <br> | &emsp; | &emsp;   |- image_name2.xml
      <br> | &emsp; | &emsp;   |_ ...
       </p>
       <br>
  
      The Annotations must be in Pascal VOC XML format. The user may use Roboflow to convert any annotation type. <br>
      Create a .txt file that contains the names of all the classes you want to detect, with each class name on a separate line. <br>
